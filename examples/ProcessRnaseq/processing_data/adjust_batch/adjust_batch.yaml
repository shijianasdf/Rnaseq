description:
  project: RNA-seq experiments of controls vs. SLE patients in immune cells
  experiment: RNA-seq libraries of B cells, T cells and monocytes. Each immune cells
    include 6 samples, 3 from healthy controls and 3 from SLE patients. RNA-seq data
    is 100bp pair-ended reads generated from Illumina HiSeq sequencer. The goal is
    to common and cell-specific differential expression between controls and patients
    in 3 cell types.
